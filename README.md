# Web_Atlas

This is the public repository for the Web Atlas that accompanies the Tracks of Yu database project. This project makes the data from Ruth Mostern's *The Yellow River: A Natural and Unnatural History* available for exploration. The Web Atlas is a web-based platform that allows users to explore the data in a more interactive way.
